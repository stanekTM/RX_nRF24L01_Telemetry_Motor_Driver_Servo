# RX 12ch (servo driver, telemetry)
RC receiver nRF24L01 with ATmega328P/16Mhz, Arduino Nano or Pro Mini.
Telemetry sends the monitored voltage A1 and RSSI to TX. 
It contains 12 channels servo outputs.
This is the maximum of the Arduino RX receiver of the "Servo" library on the Atmega328P processor.
The firmware will be used for cars, boats, tanks, robots and aircraft.

This RC receiver works with RC transmitters [OpenAVRc](https://github.com/Ingwie/OpenAVRc_Dev) or 
[Multiprotocol](https://github.com/stanekTM/TX_FW_Multi_Stanek) from my fork.

Note: I use (Arduino) ATmega328P 5V/16Mhz and supply VCC only with 3.3V voltage. 
If you supply the VCC directly with a LiPo 1S cell, except for the nRF24L01, the analog voltage measurement will not work due to the VREF.

## Function
* Normal mode = LED RX is lit
* Battery voltage 1S LiPo (4.2V) < monitored voltage = RX LED flash at a interval of 0.5s
* TX transmitter off or signal loss = RX LED flash at a interval of 0.1s
* Fail-safe = servos 1 -> 12 set to neutral or individually set in code
